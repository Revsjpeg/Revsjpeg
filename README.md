👋 Hi, I’m @Revsjpeg- I go by Revs
👀 I’m interested in a ton of things all at once- but I'm GOOD at graphic design, photography and being the biggest nerd you know
🤖I’m currently learning Python, web dev, creative coding, and how to survive my teens
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything design or coding related, all open to ideas and innovation! :D
📫 How to reach me? Pigeon Mail. No, just kidding- hit me up on instagram @revs.jpeg or Linkedin (profile coming soon 0o0)
😄 Pronouns: Its 2025. Labels are old, call me whatever you want, but I do prefer He/Him :D

⚡ Currently trying to understand Life, failing miserably at it :p
